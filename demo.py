# Sample Research Document

## Introduction
This is a sample research document to demonstrate the RAG system's capabilities.

## Key Concepts
- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Vector databases for semantic search
- OpenAI embeddings for text understanding
- LangChain for AI chain orchestration

## Methodology
The system processes documents by:
1. Loading and parsing various file formats
2. Splitting text into manageable chunks
3. Converting chunks to vector embeddings
4. Storing in a vector database for retrieval

## Results
The RAG system successfully demonstrates:
- Document processing and ingestion
- Semantic search capabilities
- Contextual question answering
- Source attribution and transparency

## Conclusion
This sample document shows how the system can handle structured research content and provide intelligent responses based on the stored knowledge.
